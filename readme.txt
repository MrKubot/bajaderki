In this moment project is abandoned. 
I was trying to make heroku work - reinstalling, changing directories,
trying with few different versions of files, searching and asking on SO and groups on fb - everything failed.
I went to an old friend - pythoneveryehere and now it's working again, but still without database. 
I don't want to pay for such a little project, so I'm not working on it anymore.
